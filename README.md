# Octo Turbo
An open-source application! 

**Tip**: When you are running a npm script be sure to use: npm **run** _script_name_
```
> npm run script
```
_This example above is a fake script_

## Building:
To edit and contribute to this application, you need to first fork this repo here:

![forking](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2FCapture3.PNG?1533681765110)

Then you can edit and test the way you want, either to contribute or just to have some fun. But you need to run **npm install** to install all the required packages from npm. For those who don't know how to do this type this in your OS's terminal

``` code
> npm install
```
---

## Testing & Running:
After editing the code you will have to test your code! 

``` code
> npm run check
```

_Running **npm run check** checks to see if the packages are able to function. Not all packages will be able to be listed here. And runs an automatic security check_

It should end up like this: _Ignore error messages for now_

![check](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2Fcapture.PNG?1533776879034)

Then, you must run **npm run app** to start _Express_.

``` code
> npm run app
```

![npm run app](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2Fcapture2.PNG?1533774900483)

This starts the whole application.
