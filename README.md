# Octo Turbo
An open-source application! Started by RocketBear27, Finished by you! A random sample app.

_Please Note There Might Be NPM Package Security issues_

## Change Log:
8/8/18: Replaced Gulp with Express + NPM Scripts; Docs updated ; NPM Scripts are rapidly changing due to them not running
<br><br>
8/7/18: Basic app rendered using Gulp

## Editing:
To edit and contribute to this application, you need to first fork this repo here:

![forking](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2FCapture3.PNG?1533681765110)

Then you can edit and test the way you want, either to contribute or just to have some fun. But you need to run **npm install** to install all the required packages from npm. For those who don't know how to do this type this in your OS's terminal
``` code
> npm install
```

## Testing:
After editing the code you will have to test your code! 

``` code
> npm test
```

``` code
> nsp check
```
_Running **npm test** checks to see if the packages are able to function. Not all packages will be able to be listed here. And runs an automatic security check_

It should end up like this:

![npm check](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2Fcapture.PNG?1533773230301)

Then, you must run **npm start** to start _Express_.
