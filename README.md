# Octo Turbo
An open-source application! 

**Tip**: When you are running a npm script be sure to use: npm **run** _script_name_
```
> npm run script -s
```
_This example above is a fake script ; -s makes the console to print less noise_

## Building:
To edit and contribute to this application, you need to first fork this repo here:

![forking](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2FCapture3.PNG?1533681765110)

Please clone the repo on your machine
*Outdated

``` code
> git clone https://github.com/username/octo-turbo.git
```

Then you can edit and test the way you want, either to contribute or just to have some fun. But you need to run **npm install** to install all the required packages from npm. For those who don't know how to do this type this in your OS's terminal

``` code
> npm install
```
---

## Testing & Running:
After editing the code you will have to test your code! 

You must run **npm run app** to start _Express_.

``` code
> npm run app -s
```

![npm run app](https://cdn.glitch.com/c16530b3-dd93-4a57-936e-b6d47ae27437%2Fcapture.PNG?1533840587692)

This starts the whole application. 


If you don't like the security noise and logging, then just run: npm run **svr**.

If you don't want to run the application and only want to run the security check, then run: npm run **check**

If you would like less error messages run the command with -**s**
